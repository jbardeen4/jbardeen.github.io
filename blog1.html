    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
        Hello mates. I am REDKP. Before moving any forward, I'd like to admit I don't intend on updating anything here. <br><br>
        But I am moving from Wix because I want more control of my content, and something open source perhaps. </p>
    <p> Someplace where I can peacefully post my content, without having to worry about all this trouble</p>
    
    <h2>But why?</h2>
    <p>
        I'll try to put out long, comprehensive, interesting content. Things I truly would want to write about. <br>
        Maybe on politics, maybe current events or even movie reviews. Who knows? <br>
        The world has been spewing out so many things in the recent past, this should make things much easier for me haha! <br>
        Do check back regurarly, you don't want to be missing this. Thank you. <br>
        <br>
        Regards, <br>
        REDKP
